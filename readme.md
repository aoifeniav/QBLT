Hi! This is my first project working with JavaScript.

This web app is an online dice roller for tabletop role-playing games.

Each die color can be changed individually to suit games such as Vampire 5e, Mutant: Year Zero, Blacksad RPG, etc.

All dice colors (black, magenta, green, blue and yellow) are suitable for color blinded people.

When rolling the dice, you get each dice result, together with the sum of all results.

The same dice can be rolled again, as dice selection stays until the Clear button is clicked.
